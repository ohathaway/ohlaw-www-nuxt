          You work hard toward your life’s accomplishments. Whether that includes some measure of
          wealth, a business legacy, or raising a family you are proud of, the way you pass it all
          on to the people and causes you care about is an important part of your life’s plan. We
          can help you express your wishes for what happens to you and your estate when you no

          We believe that everyone should have at least a minimal estate plan in a place to make
          sure that things go the way they want them. A basic estate plan contains four documents:
          1) a will; 2) a living will; 3) a durable medical power of attorney; and 4) a statement of
          burial instructions. Most people will also find that additional tools will help make life
          easier for the folks they leave behind. We use trusts in a variety of ways to help with
          tax planning, probate avoidance, handling specialized assets such as firearms, and more.
          We can help you understand all of these tools and how to create a plan that protects your
          life investment.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-normal">
          If you own a business, we find it extremely helpful to build your estate plan with an
          attorney who also has the knowledge and experience in business law to make sure your
          business interests align with your estate plan. Your business is a big part of your
          legacy, and failure to plan well can leave that legacy to the wolves when you are gone.
          Good estate planning for a business owner will necessarily include good succession
          planning for the business. Check out our easy options to get the process started.
