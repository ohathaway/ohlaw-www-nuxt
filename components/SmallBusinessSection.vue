        <h2>Looking to start a business?</h2>
        <p class="fw-normal">We can help you navigate the dizzying array of choices out there.</p>
        <p class="fw-normal">
          Not really sure about differences between partnerships, LLC’s, corporations, DBA’s, etc.?
          We make sure our clients understand why they want an LLC (almost always the right answer).
        </p>
        <p class="fw-normal">
          Think it’s simple, and an online service will get you everything you need? Perhaps, and go
          for it if that’s your thing. We’ll be here if you change your mind.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-normal">
          Someone tell you that you should re-form your company as a Sub-Chapter S corporation? We
          can help you decide whether that’s really necessary, or whether you might prefer an
          easier, less expensive option.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-normal">
          Uh oh, there’s more than one owner of the business? Oh the ways this can go wrong! We’ve
          been there, done that, got the judicially administered dissolution. Let us help you avoid
          the biggest, costliest mistakes folks make.
        </p>
        <h2>Already In Business But Need Some Help?</h2>
        <p class="fw-normal">
          Ok, you’ve filed your articles with the secretary of state, got your EIN from the IRS, and
          opened your bank account and secured your startup funding. Now what? First, you might want
          to double-check our checklist to see if you missed something. If you’re all set, let’s
          start doing some business!
        </p>
        <p class="fw-normal">
          Hmmm, too much business to handle? Maybe it’s time to hire some employees. This opens a
          whole new can of worms we can help you wrangle. Employment agreements vs. compensation
          plans, non-competes, NDA’s, we can create, review or negotiate any of these and more.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-normal">
          Oh yeah, you need a place for your business to live. We can help you make sure you protect
          your interests with the lease terms.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-normal">
          Vendor contracts. Ugh. Lots of words in the way of getting your stuff. Don’t ignore them.
          They’ll come back to haunt you and cost you money. Our services are a lot less expensive.
