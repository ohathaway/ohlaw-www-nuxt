## Our Firm

Every law firm claims to be "different." Every law firm claims to care about their clients' needs above all else. Every law firm claism to have "the world's greatest attorneys." Since you're here, you may be expecting to hear the same from us. Instead, read on to see how we stake a more modest claim. We are a family that operates a small business helping other families and small businesses establish and maintain rock-solid legal foundations that support the life and dreams they're building.

### Family First

Like most families, it has been a long and winding road to where we are today. We were married in 2000, just after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem" target="_blank" title="Y2K Bug">Y2k bug blew up (or maybe it did't) all the world's computers</a> Owen was running IT departments for hospitals, and Michelle had just finished college. Not long after, with baby on the way, we both decided that it was important for us that someone, in our case Michelle, be a full-time parent for our kids. That decision, and the values we hold that led to it, have been central to every decision we've made together ever since.

### Lawyer Second

Then Owen's work told him he had to implement this new law called HIPAA. Believe it or not, this led to a new love affair... the law. You see, Owen had always been fascinated with how things work (not just <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28114573-the-way-things-work" target="_blank" title="The Way Things Work Now, by David Macauley">the book</a>, but for real too). It turns out that one way of being a lawyer is to know how things work and use that knowledge to serve your community. So off to law school while starting our first business selling Jeep accessories online, working as a full time tech consultant helping spend $16 million in federal grant money, and still driving the kids (three now) to school every morning.

### Building Businesses

Shortly after passing the bar, one of Owen's clients asked him to join their small, family-owned private equity firm. They bought and operated technology-forward healthcare service companies, and it was a natural fit. Together, they bought and built companies until Owen realized that the private equity game isn't in his blood the way building around passion is. It was also time to stop driving 90 miles to work every day. Meanwhile, Michelle had started a part-time job mostly as something to do, and it wasn't working out very well. So we decided to start our own business.

### Putting it All Together
