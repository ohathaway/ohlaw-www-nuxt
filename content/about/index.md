## Our Firm

Every law firm claims to be "different." Every law firm claims to care about their clients' needs above all else. Every law firm claims to have "the world's greatest attorneys." Since you're here on a law firm's "About Us" page, you may be expecting to hear the same from us. Read on to see how we stake a more modest claim. We are a family that operates a small business helping other families and small businesses establish and maintain rock-solid legal foundations that support the lives and dreams they're building.

### Family First

Like most families, it has been a long and winding road to where we are today. We were married in 2000, just after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem" target="_blank" title="Y2K Bug">Y2k bug blew up (or maybe it didn't) all the world's computers</a> Owen was running IT departments for hospitals, and Michelle had just finished college. Not long after, with baby on the way, we both decided that it was important for us that someone, in our case Michelle, be a full-time parent for our kids. That decision and the values we hold that led to it have been central to every decision we've made together ever since.

### Lawyer Second

Then Owen's work told him he had to implement this new law called HIPAA. Believe it or not, this led to a new love affair... the law. You see, Owen had always been fascinated with how things work (not just <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28114573-the-way-things-work" target="_blank" title="The Way Things Work Now, by David Macauley">the book</a>, but for real too). It turns out that one way of being a lawyer is to know how things work and use that knowledge to serve your community. So off to law school while starting our first business selling Jeep accessories online, working as a full time tech consultant helping spend $16 million in federal grant money, and still driving the kids (three now) to school every morning.

### Building Businesses

Shortly after passing the bar, one of Owen's clients asked him to join their small, family-owned private equity firm. They bought and operated technology-forward healthcare service companies, and it was a natural fit. Together, they bought and built companies until Owen realized that the private equity game wasn't in his blood the way building around passion is. It was also time to stop driving 90 miles to work every day. Meanwhile, Michelle had started a part-time job mostly as something to do, and it wasn't working out very well. So we decided to start our own business.

### Putting it All Together

It turns out that when it comes to family-owned businesses, it's super important not to forget the "family" part. That means our business needed to be able to serve the family as well as the business. And families come in all sorts of configurations, colors, and economic conditions. As people who value serving others, we wanted to be able to work with any family, not just upper-middle class or wealthy families. We aim to be able to meaningfully serve any family. We call it "from the outhouse to the penthouse."

So that's why we chose to build the array of services we offer. We can help folks in a debt crisis by helping them through a bankruptcy. We call it "Clean Slate." Once the debt is cleared out, we can work with folks who want it to build businesses on a solid foundation. We call it "Suit & Shield." Even if our folks don't want to run a business, we work with them to build the same type of foundation for their lives, we call it "Life & Legacy."
