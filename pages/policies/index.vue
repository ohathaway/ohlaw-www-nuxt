      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p>
        To paraphrase the butler in
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiZ8D9akdV4">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a
        >, this is a law firm, and we have many rules. Fortunately they make a lot of sense, and you
        probably already intuitively know how a law firm, attorneys, and attorneys' staff members
        should act. Basically, it's "Do the right thing."
      </p>
      <p>
        To learn specifics of what that means in different situations, you can read our policies
        here.

        </li>

      <p>
        Oh, the one real important thing that may not be real intuitive: reading something on this
        web site does not mean that you have an attorney representing you and giving you legal
        advice. We will always send an engagement letter to a new client. This letter is the only
        way we agree to be your attorney. Ever.
