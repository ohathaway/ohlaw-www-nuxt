      <h1>Fees and Charges:</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We offer legal services under two different fee structures, full representation and
          unbundled services. Some types of matters we handle only under full representation. Other
          types of matters we handle either way.
        </li>
        <li>
          After our first meeting, we may ask you to sign a fee letter in which the fee structure
          for our work together will be clearly spelled out.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Full Representation</h2>
      <ol start="3">
        <li>
          Under our full representation fee structures, you will be billed on an hourly basis for
          all time we spend working on your behalf. This includes any office or telephone
          discussions that we have with you, as well as initial consultations. In addition, we
          reserve the right to charge an additional fee based on various factors, such as the
          results, complexity, urgency or uniqueness of the matter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our hourly fees presently are $225.00 an hour for attorneys and $100.00 an hour for
          paralegals. We attempt to assign your work in the most cost-effective manner; however, an
          attorney will supervise your case. We are not permitted to underwrite your expenses
          incurred in the representation. Hence, you are responsible for reimbursing us our
          out-of-pocket expenses that we advance in your representation (such as travel, tolls,
          filing fees, recording, government certificates, etc.) and our internal charges (such as
          long-distance telephone, facsimile transmissions, overnight or other courier service,
          photocopying, etc.). These various costs and expenses will be billed separately and
          reflected on your monthly billing statement.
        </li>
        <li>
          For full representation clients, we will request a fee deposit from you. We place this
          payment in a trust account to be held as deposit for your benefit. We will return any
          unused portion of this deposit at the conclusion of our representation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our statements for services rendered and costs incurred are due and payable upon receipt.
          If a statement remains unpaid for more than thirty (30) days, we reserve the right upon
          notice to you to withhold further services until the statement is paid, and, in addition,
          we may decline further services following payment unless a satisfactory deposit is made
          towards the payment of future services. If legal action is undertaken to collect an
          account due, you will be liable for court costs and attorneys’ fees incurred plus a late
          payment charge of 5% of the delinquent balance.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>We are often asked how a client may keep legal fees to a minimum. This is our advice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide us with complete, accurate and organized information and documentation.</li>
        <li>Try not to change your mind in the middle of a transaction.</li>
        <li>
          Do not wait until the last minute. Last minute rushes require extraordinary measures and
          costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Respond promptly to requests for information and for approval and execution of documents.
          Delays necessitate follow up measures which take time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Fixed Fee Representation</h2>
      <ol start="7">
        <li>
          We offer certain types of representation at fixed fees. We can do so because we know the
          processes and can fairly predict the requirements of the representation. Typically, these
          engagements include a certain set of services with additional charges for things that
          happen outside the ordinary course of those matters. Our representation of you may or may
          not continue beyond delivery of the services depending on how we agree to proceed.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Unbundled Service Representation</h2>
      <ol start="8">
        <li>
          We offer certain types of services following an unbundled representation model. We can do
          so because we limit our representation strictly to the services purchased. These
          engagements include a certain set of services with additional charges for things that
          happen outside the ordinary course of those matters. Our representation of you stops once
          we deliver the service.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h1>Our commitments:</h1>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Consistent communication between the lawyers and clients.</li>
        <li>
          Respect for the legal system. This includes effective communications with the opposing
          parties, counsel for opposing parties, third-parties, and the Court. Respect for the legal
          system is best shown by honesty, timeliness and courtesy to all.
        </li>
        <li>Professional and community service.</li>
        <li>Investment in technology.</li>
      </ol>
      <h1>Terms of Engagement:</h1>
      <p>
        Our representation of you begins once you sign an engagement letter with us or we
        acknowledge acceptance of your representation in writing. Contacting us via our web site
        does not mean that we become your attorney. Purchasing a bundled service via our website
        does not mean that we become your attorney. You may terminate our services prospectively at
        any time upon written notice to us at which time we will return any unearned fees you have
        paid us. Likewise, the firm reserves the right to resign as counsel upon reasonable notice
        to you. If we are counsel of record for you in a litigation matter, we will tender an order
        for you to endorse authorizing our withdrawal as counsel. If you or we terminate our
        engagement, we will take reasonable steps to protect our and your interest in the matter for
        which we were engaged. Unless sooner terminated, our engagement as counsel will be concluded
        upon our sending you our final statement for services rendered, and thereafter, confidential
        information gained by us in our representation of you will continue to be held in confidence
        pursuant to the applicable rules of professional conduct.
      </p>
      <h1>Retention of Closed Files:</h1>
      <p>
        Upon completion of our representation, the files will be closed and indexed for our storage
        facility. The firm cannot keep old files forever and generally destroys files ten (10) years
        after the case has reached a final order or decree or when the case has been inactive for
        ten (10) years. The client has the responsibility to retrieve all personal papers or items
        from the file after completion of the case or prior to ten (10) years of inactivity, and
        authorizes the firm to destroy and/or discard the files in a secure manner after ten (10)
        years of inactivity. The client may be charged a “file retrieval” fee to retrieve files
        after the file is sent to storage. Some cases have different requirements based on various
        things. If the law requires us to retain your records longer than ten (10) years, we will
        comply with that record retention requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our firm attempts to keep all files in digital format. Digital format files may be kept
        indefinitely, but not shorter than ten (10) years. Fees will apply for paper production of
        any files that exist only in digital format.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >At the conclusion of the representation, you should inform us if you wish to have your
          papers and/or property returned to you before the files are processed to the storage
          facility.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Please remember that we provide an intangible product, legal services, and you may see only
        a small part of our efforts. This combination may result in questions, in your part,
        regarding our statement for services rendered and costs advanced. We urge you to call us as
        soon as questions arise. We find that frank and candid discussions answer most of these
        questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you find this information useful, and we look forward to working toward a successful
        resolution of the issues at hand.
