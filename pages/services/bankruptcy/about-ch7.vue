We always find something we need to update in the petition or a question that hadn't come up yet. That's way we do these meetings.`,

      `The instant we file your case, a court order automatically goes into place staying any action to try to collect from you on a debt. This means garnishments, foreclosures, and evictions all must stop, immediately. Violation of this court order is contempt of court, which means the court can impose sanctions (fines) on the creditors who disregard it.`,
      `This order is so strong that many creditors who you want to keep paying, like your car lender or your mortgage servicer, won't talk to you and may even disable your access to their online services. They also will probably stop taking automatic payments if you've set that up with them. So make sure you've made alternate arrangements to pay on the debts you want to keep after bankruptcy.`

You will be put under oath and asked a bunch of questions about your bankruptcy. Don't sweat it, and tell the truth. There shouldn't be any surprises here if you were thorough in doing your homework for us.`,
      `If there are any problems with your case, or if the trustee on your case is going to require you to pay some money or turn over a tax refund, this is when we'll most likely find out about it. We almost always know what the trustee is likely to ask for, and this is one of the biggest reasons to hire an attorney for your bankruptcy. We'll have you ready for this meeting.`

      `About 60 days after your &sect; 341 meeting, the court will issue your discharge. This is the order that wipes out all of your debt. It's a general discharge. It doesn't pick and choose. It wipes out everything that isn't subject to an exception.`,
      `The trustee can have your discharge revoked if you don't follow through on any of the payments that came up at your &sect; 341. So stay on top of those, and get in touch with us immediately if something happens to make it harder for you to make those payments. If no payments are due, you're done.`
